# 本地交付验收

以下 PowerShell 命令从部署仓库根目录开始；后端和前端分别在独立终端运行。
先阅读 [执行约束](AGENTS.md)；真实测试令牌由现有安全渠道提供，不写入文档。


Use the remote test database `csbot_backup` and the existing test token supplied securely as `CS_TEST_TOKEN`.
Do not create a new token for local delivery checks. Provide the real remote database URL through
`CS_DATABASE`; it should point at `csbot_backup`.
If the remote PostgreSQL is reached through SSH, forward it locally first and rewrite the host/port
in `CS_DATABASE` to the forwarded address.

Backend:

```powershell
cd ./csbot
# Example shape only; use the real testing credential.
$env:CS_DATABASE="postgresql+asyncpg://<user>:<password>@<host>:5432/csbot_backup"
$env:CS_SERVER_SKIP_STARTUP_CACHE="1"
$env:CS_SKIP_SCHEMA_CHECK="1"
$env:CS_DISABLE_BACKGROUND_JOBS="1"
$env:CS_WATCH_STAGE_ENABLE_PROFILE_REFRESH="0"
uv run python bot_minimal.py
```

Remote watch-stage test instances should keep background crawling disabled. Only set
`CS_WATCH_STAGE_ENABLE_PROFILE_REFRESH=1` for a run where the explicit purpose is to verify
watch-stage-triggered player profile crawling.

Frontend:

```powershell
cd ./csbot-front
$env:VITE_API_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:1234"
cmd /c npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173
```

Smoke-test a protected API with:

```powershell
curl.exe -H "Authorization: Bearer $env:CS_TEST_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d "{\"steamId\":\"76561199388088405\"}" `
  http://127.0.0.1:1234/api/watch-stage/snapshot
```

For watch-stage delivery, verify that the response is not `401`, contains a `status`, and returns
running match data when the tested Steam ID is currently in a watch-stage match. The profile fields
such as `legacyScore` may be `null` on the first response because player base data is crawled
asynchronously and rate-limited.
